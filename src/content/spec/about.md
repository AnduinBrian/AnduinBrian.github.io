# About
I mainly focus on IoT devices, hardware, automotive and RF.

In CTFs, I'm mostly into rev and pwn â€” love digging into binaries ðŸ˜„.

I'm a part of the CTF Academy team, mentored by [Shellphish](https://shellphish.net/).

I have [orange/yellow/green/blue-belt](https://pwn.college/hacker/7164) on pwn.college and have completed 2+ Flare-On challenges.
